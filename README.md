## HOW TO

see this [repo](https://github.com/Pixailz/OpenComputer) for more help

### Setup (Real PC)

1. First git clone the repo on your real computer
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Pixailz/OpenComputer
	```

1. Then copy paste the `update.template.lua` file to a new `update.lua`
	```bash
	cp update{.template,}.lua
	```

1. There's 2 options to fill up, the IP and the PORT the real PC will listen
on any HTTP request

> [!NOTE]
> One way to quickly open a webserver is by go in the repo folder and then
> `python3 -u -m http.server PORT 2>&1 | tee -a log.txt`

### Setup (OC PC)

1. Now that the Web server is up and running, you can simply type this command to
install the `update` script onto the OC PC

```OC
wget -f http://IP:PORT/update.lua /bin/update.lua
```
> [!NOTE]
> replace the IP and PORT variable with the one you setup

> [!TIP]
> Every time you launch the update command, all your configured fill will
be downloaded into the OC PC from the real one
