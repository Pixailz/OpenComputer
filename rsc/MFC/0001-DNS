---------------------------------------------------------

1. Definition

	ADDRESSE		: MAC Addresse of the host
	PROTOCOL		: Port the user wan't to get
	SAFE_DATABASE	: /usr/dns/DNS_RECORD
	DNS_RECORD		: File storing ADDRESSE and PUB_KEY

2. Goal

	Securely retrieve an ADDRESSE about a PROTOCOL

3. Cmd

	GET <PROTOCOL>
		Get DNS_RECORD by PROTOCOL

	SET <PROTOCOL> <PUB_KEY>
		Set registration, linking a DNS_RECORD to a PROTOCOL

	REM <PROTOCOL>
		Unregister DNS_RECORD

4. Security Concern

	Is previously established that:

	1. an ADDRESSE is NOT spoofable
	2. ADDRESSE of the DNS is known by the user (could update in the future)

5. Cache

	Save DNS_RECORD
